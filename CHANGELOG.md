# Changelog

All notable changes to daemonseed are recorded here, one entry per release.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) on
the wire protocol (the `0.x` crate versions are tag-driven; `Cargo.toml` stays
`0.1.0`).

**This file plus the SSH-signed git tags are the canonical record of milestone
history** — what shipped, when, under which tag. Each entry corresponds to one
signed tag (`git tag --verify vX.Y.Z`). Nothing else in the repository
duplicates this record: `ISA.md` is the frozen design contract (principles,
boundaries, criteria — not history), live ISC coverage comes from
`cargo xtask isc-coverage`, and in-progress / next-milestone planning lives in
the project lead's vault manifest, never committed here.

Milestone identifiers (`Mn`) are the internal planning labels; the release tag
is the durable anchor.

## [Unreleased]

In-progress and next-milestone planning is tracked in the project lead's vault
manifest (not committed). The next entry is added here at the moment a release
is tagged, as part of the doc-sync ritual in `AGENTS.md`.

## [0.19.0] — M15, close the TUI gap

Brings the TUI to parity with the CLI for the full share loop, plus honest
coverage tooling.

- **Circle-entropy gate (ISC-C9):** a real ≥128-bit key-space estimator
  (`passphrase::strength::estimate_circle` — distinct BIP-39 words + a charset
  residue, with a zxcvbn low-end veto) driving a bits-driven join meter,
  replacing the M14 interim proxy.
- **Share publishing from the TUI:** publish / serve / unpublish a share via
  `[p]` / `[u]` on a defined share (define once, then publish — no separate
  Publish pane). Serving is session-scoped; the relay reaps on disconnect
  (ISC-S20).
- **Downloads:** a fetched share lands as named files in a per-share folder
  under a downloads root (`<profile>/downloads` in `--portable`, else the OS
  Downloads directory). Path-traversal-safe; nothing is written until the whole
  fetch verifies (ISC-C63/C64/C65, ISC-A-C31/A-C32).
- **Identity in chat + listings:** public-room posts and share listings carry
  the sender's display handle, so peers see the name rather than the `#hash`
  floor / "(operator)". The share-fetch overlay shows a progress gauge.
- **Coverage tooling:** the ISC registry `TOTAL` / `COVERED` are single-sourced
  in a new zero-dependency `daemonseed-isc` leaf crate read by both the
  integration tests and `xtask isc-coverage`; reconciled to the built ISA
  criteria (`TOTAL` 122 → 133, honest 100/133).

## [0.18.0] — M14, share-management surface + persistence

The TUI gains a **Define-Share** input box: type a local directory (`path` or
`path|label`) and the net actor opens the redb share index and cold-scans it on a
dedicated background thread — the command loop never blocks and the index stays
queryable during the scan (redb MVCC, ISC-A-C7). Defined roots **persist** in the
at-rest blob as a `share` directive (ISC-C21) and **re-index automatically** on the
next daily-login Unlock, mirroring circle rejoin. The share-index key is derived as
a **sibling of the at-rest key from a single Argon2id run** (domain-separated
HKDF-Expand, ISC-C3 / A-C6); the at-rest key output is byte-identical to before, so
existing blobs open unchanged. Also folds in the M13 deferrals: a circle-join
**entropy meter** with the ISC-C9 join gate, and a relay-independent **circle
fingerprint** (coded, not yet surfaced). Publishing remains operator/CLI-side; the
TUI is fetch + local-index only. No wire change.

## [0.17.0] — M13, persistence keystone

The at-rest seeds blob now persists display name, mute list, hidden-shares, and
circle membership (ISC-C51 / C15 / C16 / C59), restored on a daily-login Unlock;
circles silently rejoin without re-typing the phrase. A cached `SealingKey`
(`daemonseed_core::storage::seeds`) re-seals the blob on each mutation with no
second Argon2id (the Pi-4 floor); circle entropy + label are stored as hex
directive lines and stay non-mnemonic-derivable, so a mnemonic-only recovery
never reconstructs the social graph. This persists configuration, not history —
the no-client-history property is intact. No wire change.

## [0.16.0] — multi-circle carousel

Simultaneous membership in N circles (joining ADDS, never evicts), a split chat
view (lobby pane + active-circle carousel pane), arrow-key cycling of the active
circle, deterministic client-local labels, and per-circle surface isolation +
attribution (ISC-C59–C62 / A-C29 / A-C30). Purely client-side, no wire change.

## [0.15.1] — chat-surface precedence fix

Posts route to the joined circle rather than the auto-joined lobby, plus a
compose-box surface indicator. Client-only.

## [0.15.0] — alpha2 batch

Opaque server-assigned `share_id` (S21 / A-S15); share download
(S27–S29 / A-S20–A-S21); interactive public rooms — the auto-joined lobby
(S22–S26 / A-S16–A-S19 / C56–C58); client-identity lifecycle — first-start
persists the seeds blob + config + `.dseed`, daily-login Unlock, no-clobber of an
existing identity (C47–C51 / A-C26–A-C28); `--portable` mode forcing the CWD as
profile root (C52).

## [0.14.0] — M12, alpha1 MVP

The last two MVP-gate steps under one additive SemVer MINOR wire bump.
**Step 5** — user-publish file sharing: `PublishShare` / `UnpublishShare` /
`ListPublicShares` over the PublicSpace service; a RAM-only per-connection
registry (`SharePublishRegistry`), `publish` holds the connection open until
Ctrl-C, and `ShareReapGuard` reaps the share on real disconnect
(ISC-A-S1 / A-S5b / S4). **Step 6** — the federation introducer endpoint
(`FederationIntroducer` gRPC over the already-shipped
`IntroducerQuery`/`IntroducerResponse`) + the TUI Servers-pane refresh rendering
introducer-discovered candidates read-only, no keys, never auto-trusted
(ISC-S6 / S13 / C22 / A-C19). The full 4-daemon gate trips 10/10 → **MVP declared**.

## [0.13.0] — M11, MVP-gate client surfaces

The real interactive ratatui TUI driving the full transaction, M9 surface
wiring, public-space (MOTD + announcements) view, suite-deprecation policy
surfacing (fetch + ML-DSA verify + anti-rollback), and clean-device recovery
from a 24-word mnemonic / `.dseed` file — all over already-shipped, already-served
server APIs (no new wire protocol). Trips gate steps 3/7/8.

## [0.12.1] — M10-completion

Scaffolds the two platform-gated M10 ISCs as abstraction-only: C7
biometric/secure-enclave session-passphrase unlock and C20 OS-native autostart
(traits + opt-in `ProfileConfig` flags, default off; platform halves reserved to
M10-infra). Also brings every LAMA manifest (root + per-crate) to canonical
LAMA 0.1.

## [0.12.0] — M10-core, verifiable core

Release trust anchor + N-of-M ML-DSA-87 multi-sig verify
(`daemonseed_core::release`), the server boot-gate that refuses to boot on failed
verify (no boot-with-warning path), and the client update-lifecycle FSM
(verify-before-apply / never-auto-install / no-silent-downgrade /
wipe-and-log-on-failure). Plus the M9 per-key rate-limit RAII drop-guard and the
ISC-S20 coverage backfill. Closes S18 / A-S13 / C27 / A-C11.

## [0.11.0] — M9, abuse-resilience + chat affordances

Server: multi-granularity RAM-only rate limits (per-connection token bucket +
subscription/verify caps), per-identity-key connection table GC'd on disconnect,
uniform silent close (S17 / A-S12). Client: exponential+jitter reconnect backoff
with an 8-retry budget (C26); mute + hide-shares persisted in the seeds blob,
never leaked (C15 / C16 / A-C3); @-mention recognition + resolution as pure
functions with no new server-visible distinction (C17 / C18 / A-C4).

## [0.10.0] — M8, circle-of-trust relay + indexer

Circle-of-trust live relay (refcounted bidi Subscribe, reap-at-zero), flat
metadata-free circle key derivation, per-relay rendezvous addressing, a
content-addressed chunk store, and the encrypted incremental redb share indexer
with Pi-civility background scanning. Added ISC-S20.

## [0.9.0] — M7, suite deprecation + trust-event taxonomy

Suite deprecation policy (operator-signed, replay-protected cutoffs) + the
trust-event taxonomy (four affordance classes, closed `TrustEventKey` enum,
bounded encrypted audit log).

## [0.8.0] — M6, public space

The first post-Authenticated application service (PublicSpace gRPC). Verify-and-
serve signed announcement posts (S7) + MOTD (S9) against an operator signer
whitelist (S8) with a non-removable project-release entry; operator rating
taxonomy published, never enforced (S10 / A-S5b); public-share listing surface
(S4); client rating selection + filter plumbing (C19 / A-C5); AGPL-§13 source URL
advertised in the handshake ack; server filesystem isolation (A-S8). Closes 12
ISCs (55→67).

## [0.7.0] — M5, federation

Per-server trusted/untrusted trust slider with TOFU pinning + rotation notices
(C22), introducer responses that never carry public keys (S6), server-to-server
peering reusing the same slider (S12) with introduce-to-clients suppression (S13)
and active-attacker-resistant don't-introduce (A-S7), reference-client connection
cap (A-C10).

## [0.6.0] — M4b, identity-proof handshake

Post-HELLO identity-proof: mutual ML-DSA-87 envelopes bound to the TLS exporter
channel binding, ±5 min freshness + per-key replay counters, Versioned →
Authenticated type-state gate, uniform close on failure. Closes S19 / A-S14 /
A-C18 / A-S12 / A-S1.

## [0.5.0] — M4a, relay daemon

Server skeleton + TLS 1.3 on :443 with ALPN h2 + APP_HELLO + type-state
`Connection<Negotiating → Versioned>`; CLI connect initiator.

## [0.4.0] — M3, crypto-suite registry

Suite registry (CNSA 2.0 baseline), `suite_id` wire-tagging on at-rest artifacts,
read-old-write-new migration on touch, circle-metadata `min_suite_id` slot.

## [0.3.0] — M2, first-start + recovery

First-start type-state orchestrator, encrypted recovery file (`.dseed`),
bootstrap-anchor selection (canonical / manual-paste).

## [0.2.0] — M1, identity primitives

BIP-39 mnemonic, HKDF-derived ML-DSA-87 / ML-KEM-1024 keypairs, profile
substrate, at-rest seeds blob, handle format (adj-noun + 12-hex fingerprint).

## [0.1.0] — M0, scaffold

Pre-implementation findings, workspace scaffolding, proto-codegen pipeline.
